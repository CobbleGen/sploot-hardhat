# Sploot contract hardhat configuration

The sploot contract allowing for minting if an address is on the allowlist.

The allowlist itself is hosted in the merkle.js file


The test is broken atm due to the public test having to change the allowlist, but to try it you can run:
```
npx hardhat test
```

To start the server hosting the mint site, run:
```
node .
```
